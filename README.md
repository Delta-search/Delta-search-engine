Delta 
Welcome to the Delta frontend repo! Delta is an innovative search engine that organizes the web in a revolutionary way. Instead of traditional search results, Delta presents information in Notelinks—a unique approach that categorizes search queries into thematic "shelves" or subtopics.

Delta’s mission is to make web navigation more intuitive, insightful, and structured. By leveraging this new approach, users can easily find the information they need in a smarter, more organized way.

Key Features
Notelinks: Delta organizes search results into logical, categorized clusters for easier exploration.

Intuitive UI: Clean, modern interface that simplifies the searching and information discovery experience.

API-driven: Designed to seamlessly connect with Delta’s backend to fetch dynamic content and search results.

Getting Started (If you want to use Delta, vist http://delta-search.github.io/)
Follow these steps to set up the Delta frontend on your local machine:

Prerequisites
A code editor such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Notepad++, or JetBrains WebStorm.

Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for understanding the structure and flow of the frontend code.

Installation
Clone the repository:

Copy
git clone https://github.com/Delta-search/Delta-frontend.git
cd Delta-repo
Since this is a static site (HTML, CSS, JS), no dependencies need to be installed via npm or yarn. Just open the HTML files locally or in your IDE.

To run the site locally:

Simply open index.html in your preferred browser, or use a simple local server like Live Server (available as an extension in Visual Studio Code).

Alternatively, if you'd like to host the site with a server: 


Copy
# Install Live Server for a quick local server if you're using VS Code
# Or use another local server tool of your choice
npm install -g live-server
live-server
Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by the server, typically http://127.0.0.1:5500/ to see the Delta frontend in action.
