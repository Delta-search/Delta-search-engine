Reporting Issues
If you encounter a bug or issue with Delta, we encourage you to report it so we can address it as quickly as possible. Here's how you can do that:

Check existing issues: Before opening a new issue, search through the Issues section of the repository to see if someone else has already reported it.

Create a new issue: If the issue hasnâ€™t been reported yet, create a new issue and include the following details:

A clear title describing the issue.

A description of what you were trying to do when the issue occurred.

Steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable.

Screenshots or error messages, if relevant.

The browser and operating system you're using.

This will help us better understand the issue and resolve it faster.

Search for existing feature requests: Before submitting a new feature request, search the Issues section to see if it has already been suggested.

Submit your feature request: If it's a new idea, create a new issue with the following information:

The reason why you think this feature would be useful.

Any additional context or resources (e.g., links to similar features in other apps).

Code of Conduct
By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the Code of Conduct, which is designed to foster an open and respectful environment for all contributors.

Development Workflow
To keep the project organized and maintain a clean codebase, please follow these practices:

Follow the Git flow: Always work on feature branches, and keep the main branch (usually main or master) clean.

Test your changes: Ensure that your code does not break existing functionality. Run the project locally to test all functionality after making changes.

Ensure your code is clean: Write clear and understandable code. Remove any commented-out code before pushing.

Style Guide
To maintain consistency across the project, please follow the Delta frontend style guide.

JavaScript (JS)
Follow the StandardJS style guide for JavaScript. It helps maintain a consistent codebase with no semicolons, appropriate indentation, and clear naming conventions.

You can install the StandardJS linter to check your code for style issues:

bash
Copy
npm install standard --save-dev
Or you can use the Prettier extension to automatically format your code.

HTML and CSS
Follow standard HTML5 and CSS3 conventions.

Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., <header>, <main>, <section>, etc.).

Keep the CSS modular, using class names that clearly describe the componentâ€™s purpose or style.

Make sure to comment your code where necessary, particularly for complex sections of HTML or CSS.
